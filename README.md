## Introduction
This page is dedicated to document the work of Janik Hoffmann and Lena J√§ger during their time at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS).
The overall objective is to make remote sensing data accessible and first products accessible and easy to use,
in a transparent way and across all disciplines.

## Background 

## Projects 

### Data visualization

In terms of data visualization, a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script was developed to show animations.
It is easily adaptable to other regions, by changing the aoi in the beginning. 
In the upper left corner is the option to draw a geometry directly in the map. The newly created Geometry import can be named and simply typed out as the aoi (line 14).
It visualizes Sentinel 2 data and important indices, namely NDVI, NDSI, NDWI and NDMI. 
The time (year and months), as well as the cloud cover can be set in line 86 to 93. 
By visualizing remote sensing data via animation, difficulties for satellite remote sensing become quite prominent, as well as the potential.
It can be clearly observed, that cloud cover is quite frequent. But still, when animating a whole season, the pattern of greening and start of snow cover can be detected. 
An animation example is illustrated below.
